    Secondment Resume Database

   <li>
    Edge computer software: Laser sensor to PLC
    <ul>
   Software developed to help in the automation of the transport of raw potash from the underground boring machine onto a mobile conveyor system (flexi-veyor). This saves an operator from having to continuously monitor and control the dump location to make sure it stays centered on the conveyor belt while the equipment is moving.
Raw data from JoeScan laser scanners is read by an edge PC mounted on the machine, the position of the conveyor belt is calculated from the raw data, then the position data is sent to Rockwell PLC’s for automatic control of the auger.

        <strong>C++ (Visual Studio)</strong>
